This code also uses tesa-klebeband's wifi packet injection code. https://github.com/tesa-klebeband/RTL8720dn-WiFi-Packet-Injection
I did web server stuff
This code also demonstrates the capability of RTL8720dn performing SoftAP, promiscuous mode, and deauth at the same time (sort of).

## Installation
This program can be compiled using AmebaD SDK version 3.1.7
