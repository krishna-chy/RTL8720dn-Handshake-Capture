# RTL8720dn-Handshake-Capture
Capture WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake using BW16 (RTL8720dn)

## Fork Information
This code is a fork of Nickguitar's code. https://github.com/Nickguitar/cypher-5G-deauther <br>
This code also uses tesa-klebeband's wifi packet injection code. https://github.com/tesa-klebeband/RTL8720dn-WiFi-Packet-Injection <br>
I did web server stuff <br>
This code also demonstrates the capability of RTL8720dn performing SoftAP, promiscuous mode, and deauth at the same time (sort of). <br>

## Installation
This program can be compiled using AmebaD SDK version 3.1.7 <br>
Because I modified some of the core libraries, you may encounter a problem. Please let me know so I can fix it. <br>
