## Overview

The **RTL8720dn Handshake Capture** project enables users to capture WPA/WPA2 4-way handshakes using the BW16 module. This tool is designed for security researchers and enthusiasts who want to explore Wi-Fi security protocols and improve their understanding of wireless network vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Capture WPA/WPA2 Handshakes**: Effectively capture the necessary packets for authentication.
- **Support for 5GHz Networks**: Operate on 5GHz frequencies to access a broader range of networks.
- **Brute Force Capability**: Once handshakes are captured, utilize brute force methods to test password strength.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and clear outputs make it easy to use for both beginners and experts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RTL8720dn Handshake Capture, you will need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/krishna-chy/RTL8720dn-Handshake-Capture/releases). Download the file, extract it, and follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/krishna-chy/RTL8720dn-Handshake-Capture/releases) and download the latest version.
2. **Extract Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your desired directory.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install <required-libraries>
   ```
4. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the extracted folder and execute the main script:
   ```bash
   ./start_capture.sh
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start capturing handshakes. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to get you going:

1. **Start the Capture**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ./start_capture.sh
   ```
2. **Select Network**: The tool will list available networks. Choose the one you want to target.
3. **Monitor the Capture**: Watch the console for captured packets. The tool will indicate when a handshake is successfully captured.
4. **Brute Force Testing**: After capturing, use the included brute force script to test the strength of the captured handshake.
